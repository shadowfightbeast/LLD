üõí LLD Question: Design a Shopping Cart System
üéØ Problem Statement
Design a simple e-commerce shopping cart system with the following requirements:

‚úÖ Requirements:
1. Product Catalog
There are multiple products.

Each product has: id, name, price, category.

2. Shopping Cart
A user can add or remove products from the cart.

A cart contains multiple items.

Each item has a quantity and refers to a product.

3. Price Calculation
Calculate total price of the cart.

Apply discounts/promotions:

If total cart value > $500, apply 10% discount.

If a product belongs to category "Electronics", apply 5% discount on that product.

4. Support multiple users, each with a separate cart.
‚öôÔ∏è Extended/Optional Features (Bonus)
Allow checkout which finalizes the cart and creates an order.

Maintain a record of past orders per user.

Support promo codes or coupon discounts.

Track inventory for each product.

Would you like to:

Try solving it yourself and I review it?

Or should I go ahead and implement the design + code for you like we did with the parking lot system?



Would you like to add:

Checkout + Order creation?

Inventory management?

Promo codes / coupons?
